/*
;	Note on PixelsPerFrame: The need for this parameter probably isn't
;	that obvious, so a little explanation is in order. This
;	parameter is used to determine if the pathfinder has gotten close
;	enough to the center of a given path square to warrant looking up
;	the next step on the path.
;	 
;	This is needed because the speed of certain sprites can
;	make reaching the exact center of a path square impossible.
;	In Demo #2, the chaser has a velocity of 3 pixels per frame. Our
;	tile size is 50 pixels, so the center of a tile will be at location
;	25, 75, 125, etc. Some of these are not evenly divisible by 3, so
;	our pathfinder has to know how close is close enough to the center.
;	It calculates this by seeing if the pathfinder is less than 
;	pixelsPerFrame # of pixels from the center of the square. 

;	This could conceivably cause problems if you have a *really* fast
;	sprite and/or really small tiles, in which case you may need to
;	adjust the formula a bit. But this should almost never be a problem
;	for games with standard sized tiles and normal speeds. Our smiley
;	in Demo #4 moves at a pretty fast clip and it isn't even close
;	to being a problem.
